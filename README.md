# 2048
This is a port of the 2048 game as an Opera sidebar extension. 2048 itself is a small clone of [1024](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.veewo.a1024), based on [Saming's 2048](http://saming.fr/p/2048/) (also a clone).

Made just for fun. You can [play it on the web too](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/), but having it as part of the browser sidebar makes for more convenient gaming.
